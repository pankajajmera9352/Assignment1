This Python code generates random strings of varying base representations and then analyzes the frequency distribution of the highest base digit in those strings. Here's a breakdown:

1. Mapping Creation:
mapping_dict is created to map integers 0 to 9 to themselves and integers 10 to 35 to corresponding uppercase letters (A to Z). The loop converts the values to strings.

2. Random String Generation:
The code generates a specified sample_size (1,000,000) of random strings (random_numbers). Each string consists of two random digits (0 to 35) from mapping_dict. Then, up to 8 more digits are added based on coin tosses, following the mapping rules.

3. Reverse Mapping:
reverse_mapping_dict is created to map characters back to their original integers.

4. Frequency Analysis:
base_frequency is a dictionary to store the frequency of the highest base digit for each generated string. It iterates through the generated random numbers and calculates the highest base for each string, updating the frequency.

5. Plotting:
Finally, a bar plot using Matplotlib is created to visualize the frequency distribution of the highest base digits.# Assignment1
